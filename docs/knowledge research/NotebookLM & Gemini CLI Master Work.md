NotebookLM & Gemini CLI: Master Workflow ArchitectureThis document outlines high-parity workflows designed for a "Studio Mode" environment, leveraging NotebookLM for grounded synthesis and Gemini CLI for automated execution.1. The "Auto-Digest" Pipeline (Discovery & Ingestion)Goal: Automate the filtering of high-volume research into a high-signal notebook.The Scout (CLI): Use a script to query arXiv, GitHub, or specialized news APIs. Use Gemini CLI to rank results: cat search_results.json | gemini-cli "Rank these by relevance to [Project X]. Output only the top 3 URLs."The Ingest (MCP): Use the notebooklm-mcp tool to programmatically upload discovery URLs or parsed markdown directly into your notebook, bypassing manual GUI limits.The Synthesis (NotebookLM): Use the "Audio Overview" or "Study Guide" feature to generate 5-minute technical summaries of the newly ingested sources.2. The "Global Memory" Architecture (Persistence)Goal: Solve "Siloing" by creating a cross-notebook intelligence layer using LanceDB.The Mirror: For every document uploaded to NotebookLM, trigger a Python hook to create a local vector embedding in LanceDB with custom metadata (Project ID, Tier, Date).The Context Bridge: When starting a new project, use the CLI to query LanceDB: python memory_search.py --query "Schema decisions for C.O.R.E.".The Seed: Feed the historical results into the new NotebookLM notebook as "Source 1" (The Heritage File) to ensure continuity across siloed projects.3. The "Architecture-to-Action" Loop (Execution)Goal: Move from dense technical research to functional code scaffolding and verification.Synthesis: Use NotebookLM to define a "Technical Specification" based on 10+ reference sources.Drafting: Export the spec and pass it to Gemini CLI: gemini-cli "Using this spec, generate the boilerplate for a FastAPI service and create a Dockerfile."Verification: Re-upload the generated code to NotebookLM. Use the grounded chat to ask: "Does this code violate the security constraints mentioned in Source 4?"4. The "Pulse" Continuity Sync (Daily Operations)Goal: Maintain an "Anchor Tier 3" state across long-term development sessions.EOD Log: At the end of a session, use the CLI to summarize: gemini-cli "Summarize today's resolved decisions and current blockers." > session_log.md.Auto-Sync: Use a cron job or alias to upload session_log.md to a "Master Project" NotebookLM notebook via the MCP server.SOD Briefing: Every morning, ask NotebookLM: "Based on yesterday's log, what is the most critical blocker I need to address first?"5. Cross-Platform Orchestration (Multi-Agent Logic)Goal: Leverage specialized models (Claude/Gemini) to "peer review" your research.Gemini Attachment: Use the native "Attach NotebookLM" feature in the Gemini web interface to query multiple notebooks simultaneously for high-level cross-synthesis.Claude Code Skill: Use the notebooklm-mcp skill within Claude Code to let it perform deep-dive documentation research while it writes your implementation.Workflow Efficiency MatrixWorkflowPrimary ToolContext DepthSpeedAuto-DigestCLI + SearchLow (Filtering)HighGlobal MemoryLanceDB + CLIInfinite (Cross-silo)MediumAction LoopNotebookLM + CLIHigh (Grounded)HighPulse SyncCLI + DriveMedium (Temporal)HighOrchestrationGemini UI + MCPMulti-ModelMedium
