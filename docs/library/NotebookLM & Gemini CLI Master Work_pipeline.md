NotebookLM & Gemini CLI: Master Workflow ArchitectureThis document outlines high-parity workflows designed for a "Studio Mode" environment, leveraging NotebookLM for grounded synthesis and Gemini CLI for automated execution.1. The "Auto-Digest" Pipeline (Discovery & Ingestion)Goal: Automate the filtering of high-volume research into a high-signal notebook.The Scout (CLI): Query arXiv/GitHub/APIs. Use Gemini CLI to rank: cat search_results.json | gemini-cli "Rank by relevance to [Project X]."The Ingest (MCP): Use notebooklm-mcp to upload URLs/markdown directly.The Heartbeat (Hardening): Automated check to ensure MCP session cookies are active before starting bulk ingestion.2. The "Global Memory" Architecture (Persistence)Goal: Solve "Siloing" via a cross-notebook intelligence layer using LanceDB.The Mirror: Every upload to NotebookLM triggers a local vector embedding in LanceDB with metadata (notebook_id, source_name, tags).The Context Bridge: Before a new task, the CLI queries LanceDB: python studio_core.py search "Authentication logic".The Heritage Pattern: CLI generates a "Heritage Document" summarizing related global context and uploads it as Source #1 in the new notebook.3. The "Architecture-to-Action" Loop (Execution)Goal: Move from technical research to functional code scaffolding and verification.Synthesis: Generate a "Technical Specification" in NotebookLM.Drafting: CLI consumes the spec: gemini-cli "Generate FastAPI boilerplate based on this spec."Verification: Re-upload code to NotebookLM for a grounded "Compliance Check" against original research papers.4. The "Pulse" Continuity Sync (Daily Operations)Goal: Maintain session state and "Anchor Tier 3" stability.EOD Log: CLI summarizes progress/blockers into pulse_YYYYMMDD.md.Auto-Sync: MCP-upload of the log to a "Master Project" notebook to ensure the next session starts with full context.5. Red Team Analysis (Vulnerabilities & Mitigations)Session Instability: MCP relies on browser cookies (Mitigation: check_mcp_heartbeat()).Semantic Drift: Local LanceDB and Cloud NotebookLM divergence (Mitigation: Weekly reconciliation).Source Saturation: 50-source limit (Mitigation: CLI-driven archival logic).Workflow Efficiency MatrixWorkflowPrimary ToolContext DepthSpeedAuto-DigestCLI + MCPLow (Filtering)HighGlobal MemoryLanceDB + CLIInfinite (Cross-silo)MediumAction LoopNotebookLM + CLIHigh (Grounded)HighPulse SyncCLI + DriveMedium (Temporal)High
