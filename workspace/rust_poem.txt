In the metal heart where safe pointers dwell,
A borrow checker guards the gates of hell.
No dangling reference shall pass this way,
For Rust has come to seize the systems' day.
Speed without fear, concurrent threads align,
A compile-time guarantee, by strict design.
V1.0 stands, a monument of code,
Where reliability lifts the heavy load.
